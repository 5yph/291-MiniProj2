{"abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a methodology for the visualisation and hypothetical virtual reconstruction of Roman polychrome statuary for research purposes. The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology. It is at present being implemented as part of the 'Statues in Context' project at Herculaneum and will be demonstrated here using the case study of a small area of the head of a painted female statue discovered at Herculaneum in 2006.", "authors": ["Gareth Beale", "Graeme Earl"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10482dd3-4642-4193-842f-85f3b70fcf65", "3133714c-f979-4d84-9224-97361cf053ab", "3a926fef-7422-4654-8776-8e31b45be563", "52f480e8-85e6-4c01-9e5b-d75eabf6a8ec", "6f52f995-7c4c-4a92-83aa-d1c9fbd2465c", "8bd964d6-c45f-448c-9e65-efe5f98ca0a0", "8fa0a362-6522-48fc-bd5e-24de00ed6511", "9bfa8c24-8fb6-44d9-ba42-38b22f9cf34b", "b57cc9ef-64b6-479d-9918-5f283af3219d", "b678b546-e867-4a57-8963-c5545b04f32d", "e5c40bf5-7ee2-4cff-a75a-b708ab69997b", "f0dccb0c-c17a-4fcb-a89f-fe4bdfa3356d", "fdd93623-31c8-487b-8554-d6c6b25af5f6"], "title": "A methodology for the physically accurate visualisation of roman polychrome statuary", "venue": "visual analytics science and technology", "year": 2011, "id": "001c58d3-26ad-46b3-ab3a-c1e557d16821"}

{"abstract": "Recent achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Psychology invoke the challenges to identify the insight of emotions. In the present study, we have identified different psychology related theme words while analyzing emotions on the interview data of ISEAR (International Survey of Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) research group. Primarily, we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to generate visual graphs for analyzing the impact of emotions with respect to different background, behavioral and physiological variables available in the ISEAR dataset. We have discussed some of the interesting results as observed from the generated visual graphs. On the other hand, different text clusters are identified from the interview statements by selecting individual as well as different combinations of the variables. Such textual clusters are used not only for retrieving the psychological theme words but also to classify the theme words into their respective emotion classes. In order to retrieve the psychological theme words from the text clusters, we have developed a rule based baseline system considering unigram based keyword spotting technique. The system has been evaluated based on a Top-n ranking strategy (where n=10, 20 or 30 most frequent theme words). Overall, the system achieves the average F-Scores of .42, .32, .36, .42, .35, .40 and .40 in identifying theme words with respect to Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Sadness and Shame emotion classes, respectively.", "authors": ["Ankita Brahmachari", "Priya Singh", "Avdhesh Garg", "Dipankar Das"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["84d47128-58d0-4187-aa44-389fde7d5c83", "e0dce69e-5bb6-4835-a624-066f5cd0420b", "f4b32fa0-8bc6-422b-999c-d2c32e261e1f"], "title": "Identifying Psychological Theme Words from Emotion Annotated Interviews", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "00a119c4-d367-4607-b3c8-b237f2971bff"}

{"abstract": "Three speech training systems for hearing-impaired children were designed and constructed using a minicomputer and a microprocessor. The first system displays the lateral shape of the vocal tract for each vowel estimated from the speech sound. In this system, three storages are prepared. One of them can be used to store a reference shape which may be estimated from a teacher's voice or a prepared standard shape. A child can articulate seeing the reference shape and re-articulate comparing his own first articulation with the reference shape. The system can also compare the estimated shape with the reference one and produce instructions with animated cartoons which show where any articulatory defects exist. The second system displays successively the lateral shapes for articulation of any phoneme sequences containing consonants. The third system displays the first two formant frequencies extracted from speech as a spot on the F1-F2 plane, where the regions of vowels are shown in color. Preliminary use of these devices has shown that they complement each other to form a more effective system of speech training.", "authors": ["Minoru Shigenaga", "Yoshihiro Sekiguchi"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Speech training systems using lateral shapes of vocal tract and F1-F2 diagram for hearing-impaired children", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 1979, "id": "00ca027b-5174-40fa-bf63-9a97c2a5f518"}

{"abstract": "Spatial encryption is a generic public-key cryptosystem where vectors play the role of public keys and secret keys are associated to affine spaces. Any secret key associated to a space can decrypt all ciphertexts encrypted for vectors in that space, and the delegation relation is defined by subspace inclusion. Though several constructions of spatial encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature, none of them are known to remain secure in the leakage-resilient setting, in which the adversary may be capable of learning limited additional information about the master secret key and other secret keys in the system. In this paper, we propose the first spatial encryption scheme achieving leakage resilience in the standard model, based on existing static assumptions over bilinear groups of composite order. Our new scheme is based on the leakageresilient HIBE scheme by Lewko, Rouselakis, and Waters in TCC 2011 and can be seen as a generalization of Moriyama-Doi spatial encryption scheme to the leakage-resilient setting.", "authors": ["Michel Abdalla", "Jill-J\u00eann Vie"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3140c9ba-8d98-42a7-b6b8-c58fdaa8fe75", "4708b4d5-ddd8-48f7-ab7f-e14f925fbe62", "7432d716-a4ae-42f8-9dae-6599b6f3b475", "ad0777e4-aab4-41b1-928a-2844e2da585e", "b6aea9c9-30b3-4fcb-bf8f-adb19920c137", "c086c363-f6a2-475e-9ffa-23f3c5fffcf7", "f40ff3ec-979e-4f88-ab47-520879876fed", "fb9ea451-ad58-40da-be73-6e60b6607f8f"], "title": "Leakage-Resilient spatial encryption", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "016a9a21-e882-4cda-a2b1-b2b46f10601e"}

{"abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. Early diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment and therefore of crucial importance. Medical thermography has been demonstrated an effective and inexpensive method for detecting breast cancer, in particular in early stages and in dense tissue. In this paper, we propose a medical decision support system based on analysing bilateral asymmetries in breast thermograms. The underlying data is imbalanced, as the number of benign cases significantly exceeds that of malignant ones, which will lead to problems for conventional pattern recognition algorithms. To address this, we propose an ensemble classifier system which is based on the idea of Clustering and Selection. The feature space, which is derived from a series of image symmetry features, is partitioned in order to decompose the problem into a set of simpler decision areas. We then delegate a locally competent classifier to each of the generated clusters. The set of predictors is composed of both standard models as well as models dedicated to imbalanced classification, so that we are able to employ a specialised classifier to clusters that show high class imbalance, while maintaining a high specificity for other clusters. We demonstrate that our method provides excellent classification performance and that it statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art ensembles dedicated to imbalanced problems.", "authors": ["Bartosz Krawczyk", "Gerald Schaefer", "Shao Ying Zhu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["16f0341b-538d-40f3-996c-8de7cc4dc675", "1ca19102-96fb-4b4b-a469-88ad17f36b11", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "3cbd262f-bf3c-4fcd-a143-dd1a6be49e4b", "5355c319-b80d-40de-bf24-5ab2f95cb7b1", "64b37c52-2186-4398-ba45-5566f33642ce", "87b6c1da-c179-412e-8934-228784c9c82b", "9075487a-8183-4565-ac94-0197da31e056", "a6e178c8-d55f-460c-8e5b-c9d5cfb04c20", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473", "b1e0b2d0-8a1e-42f5-8645-9fae30b8636f", "c52208d6-0dfb-400f-a19b-ed6fedfaea19", "e6b6e8f4-3c7d-4435-8ca9-192c3a76cdf8"], "title": "Breast Cancer Identification Based on Thermal Analysis and a Clustering and Selection Classification Ensemble", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "0265aea8-65f3-4f46-b8b1-6b65bcb1d38f"}

{"abstract": "The development of an automated system for the quality assessment of aerodrome ground lighting (AGL), in accordance with associated standards and recommendations, is presented. The system is composed of an image sensor, placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft to record images of the AGL during a normal descent to an aerodrome. A model-based methodology is used to ascertain the optimum match between a template of the AGL and the actual image data in order to calculate the position and orientation of the camera at the instant the image was acquired. The camera position and orientation data are used along with the pixel grey level for each imaged luminaire, to estimate a value for the luminous intensity of a given luminaire. This can then be compared with the expected brightness for that luminaire to ensure it is operating to the required standards. As such, a metric for the quality of the AGL pattern is determined. Experiments on real image data is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the system.", "authors": ["J. Niblock", "Jian-Xun Peng", "Karen McMenemy", "George W.

{"abstract": "Quality specified image retrieval is helpful to improve the user experiences in mobile searching and social media sharing. However, the model for evaluating the quality of the user generated images, which are popular in social media sharing, remains unexploited. In this paper, we propose a scheme for quality assessment on user generated image. The scheme is formed by four attribute dimensions, including intrinsic quality, favorability, relevancy and accessibility of images. Each of the dimensions is defined and modeled to pool a final quality score of a user generated image. The proposed scheme can reveal the quality of user generated image in comprehensive manner. Experimental results show that the scores obtained by our scheme have high correlation coefficients with the benchmark data. Therefore, our scheme is suitable for quality specified image retrieval on mobile applications.", "authors": ["Qiong Liu", "You Yang", "Xu Wang", "Liujuan Cao"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["04f8d077-765a-4145-bf14-bace8fc3a7c9", "07b11cc1-12ca-44d4-bcca-702d4d306dfd", "0d2e42c4-595d-449f-8738-2f0553763772", "117fa766-80c7-414e-9f65-5ae1a057fdd6", "19b5f75e-faec-42bb-a795-d6728e493ae8", "27ac42a2-1eb4-4060-80a6-c0a0566bfaf0", "30da015e-fc53-4de5-91b8-18e28f1281d2", "4c859183-ef97-49be-ba88-e096def9acf2", "638ae38d-2880-4c40-8bfc-86510ec17c96", "71198e87-8fba-4bb9-9b0e-286820c815b1", "7dff52ca-5ee1-416f-9e54-8e4a2e42ef9e", "7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7", "8575572a-2b87-4cbb-b260-746ddedc4637", "900e5460-9bf1-4fc9-a709-48f16cad4b77", "96564de0-6158-4564-abdf-1533164ae91f", "adea5377-3a51-4831-add5-80ebf31685e1", "c09dd382-6958-408b-aea7-4f5972031e4e", "c2b03f8f-8de3-40a2-ba0e-f0c9142151d3", "c5799806-44a9-4e53-a9ef-0482abc74bf2", "c8263f04-6d4e-4828-89de-f5418cefd1d7", "caaff64a-e3cb-4f06-a292-34994f34417c", "dd4eb389-91ba-498c-b37e-ff757fd1a30f", "ea0912eb-9116-42e7-b7db-fdd1f0b2d6f1", "eb3f6c15-20d6-4d73-8412-cbe15df31bbf", "feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f"], "title": "Quality Assessment on User Generated Image for Mobile Search Application", "venue": "conference on multimedia modeling", "year": 2013, "id": "02a5e8a8-061e-4c1f-ab16-bda035578e54"}

The stability of the solutions is discussed, and the methods of competitive modes is used to describe parameter regimes for which chaotic behaviors may appear. Numerical solutions are employed to better demonstrate the dependence of traveling wave solutions on the physical parameters in the Yukawa model.

{"abstract": "The paper discusses the design principles and current status of a natural language front end for access to data bases. This Is based on the use, first, of a semantically-oriented question analyser exploiting general, language-wide semantic categories and patterns, rather than data base-specific ones; and, second, of a data base-oriented translation component for obtaining search specifications from the meaning representations for questions derived by the analyser. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the effort of providing data base-specific material for the front end, by the belief that a general analyser is well suited to the \"casual\" data base user, and by the assumption that the rich semantic apparatus used will be both adequate as a means of analysis and appropriate as a tool for linking the characterisations of input and data language items.

{"abstract": "State-space explosion is a major obstacle in verification of time-critical distributed systems. An important factor with a negative influence on the tractability of the analysis is the size of constants that clocks are compared to. This problem is particularly accented in ex- plicit state-space exploration techniques. We suggest an approximation method for reducing the size of constants present in the model. The proposed method is developed for Timed-Arc Petri Nets and creates an under-approximation or an over-approximation of the model behaviour. The verification of approximated Petri net models can be considerably faster but it does not in general guarantee conclusive answers. We im- plement the algorithms within the open-source model checker TAPAAL and demonstrate on a number of experiments that our approximation techniques often result in a significant speed-up of the verification.", "authors": ["Sine Viesmose Birch", "Thomas Stig Jacobsen", "Jacob Jon Jensen", "Christoffer Moesgaard", "Niels N\u00f8rgaard Samuelsen", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Srba"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["05187588-ada5-47d3-ab0d-a282be6fc447", "2230c340-e108-418b-a1ab-c40ef3eaefe5", "260b34ec-bd5e-487e-9e8a-b479dc679345", "26ba289c-7209-4d40-a7c3-3acc2bd88f65", "2a8da6cc-4c7e-480a-929b-d41ee021ccf4", "357c3e46-8be2-422d-b54f-74dbc52e0d3e", "4fccb3c3-45e6-46b9-8806-50d8451fb840", "50f10b22-b641-47ba-b594-d8af05f4c3d5", "80c5d053-0786-4d72-9cb8-a0a3217bd49e", "8512d397-7900-4842-81eb-8a7935a772df", "871abaad-e9bb-4f97-8dc5-081305d73bb9", "92d10f3d-c071-49d4-b9ee-b53151d80aa7", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "a02087e5-151c-4061-b172-7770f51f84f6", "b9406df7-db37-4dd8-83d9-90b6b1713f2d", "c45016d5-4794-4c33-a2d0-f7d30a38f9ef", "d196ebe5-517e-4423-a021-ec7206cad311", "d50cac03-25bc-47fd-9a27-2be1052bd5e9", "e2f00686-d81e-4d69-b5e3-88a9d8d2e7f9", "e67d1f2b-624c-424e-a4e0-7ba8ff810b14", "ecf23f31-b26e-45aa-8b56-674b89ef15f7", "ff3e5819-210a-4ada-b654-33a95105d77a"], "title": "Interval Abstraction Refinement for Model Checking of Timed-Arc Petri Nets", "venue": "formal modeling and analysis of timed systems", "year": 2014, "id": "03dd4db1-3540-4de6-b8f4-5d79cc538dd7"}

In this part we also discussed building an image database that can be used for evaluating steganography/steganalysis fairly.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a rapid, adaptive assessment of the difference threshold (DL) of passive metacar- pophalangeal index finger joint flexion using a robotic device. Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) is compared to the method of constant stimuli (MOCS) using a two-alternative forced-choice par- adigm. The pilot study with 13 healthy subjects provided DLs within similar ranges for MOCS and PEST, averaging at 2.15 \u25e6 \u00b1 0.77 \u25e6 and 1.73 \u25e6 \u00b10.78 \u25e6 , respectively, in accordance with the literature. However, no significant correlation was found between the two methods (r(11) = 0.09, p =0 .762). The average number of trials required for PEST to converge was 58.7\u00b1 17.6, and significantly lower compared to 120 trials for MOCS ( p< 0.001), leading to an assessment time of under 15 min. These results suggest that rapid, adaptive methods, such as PEST, could be success- fully implemented in novel robotic tools for clinical assessment of sensory deficits.", "authors": ["Mike D.

{"abstract": "Entailment pairs are sentence pairs of a premise and a hypothesis, where the premise textually entails the hypothesis. Such sentence pairs are important for the development of Textual Entailment systems. In this paper, we take a closer look at a prominent strategy for their automatic acquisition from newspaper corpora, pairing first sentences of articles with their titles. We propose a simple logistic regression model that incorporates and extends this heuristic and investigate its robustness across three languages and three domains. We manage to identify two predictors which predict entailment pairs with a fairly high accuracy across all languages. However, we find that robustness across domains within a language is more difficult to achieve.", "authors": ["Manaal Faruqui", "Sebastian Pad\u00f3"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["484d1994-e9da-477d-9be2-1f1e154cd919", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "71103b6f-e0a7-4eff-9759-b101db960813", "740934af-33dd-4725-9755-5905b5b2950b", "c3f183fc-1f5d-44a9-85c4-c81a03e89586", "c92afebe-c430-4bb8-9ef9-6a46981d2008", "f82b5743-01a4-45f3-bce7-b0ea605b77a1"], "title": "Acquiring entailment pairs across languages and domains: a data analysis", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "05e535a9-2021-4393-a19e-6a0277034323"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses an optimization-based approach for the design of RF integrated inductors. The methodology presented deals with the complexity of the design problem by formulating it as a multi-objective optimization. The multi-modal nature of the underlying functions combined with the need to be able to explore design trade-offs leads to the use of niching methods. This allows exploring not only the best trade-off solutions lying on the Pareto-optimum surface but also the quasi-optimum solutions that would be otherwise discarded. In this paper we take advantage of the niching properties of lbest PSO algorithm using ring topology to devise a simple optimizer able to find the local-optima. For the efficiency of the process analytical models are used for the passive/active devices. In spite the use of physics-based analytical expressions for the evaluation of the lumped elements, the variability of the process parameters is ignored in the optimization stage due to the significant computational burden it involves. Thus in the final stage both the Pareto- optimum solutions and the quasi-optimum solutions are evaluated with respect to the sensitivity to process parameter variations.", "authors": ["Pedro Pereira", "Fernando Vieira Coito", "M.

{"abstract": "Process-based context-aware applications are increasingly be- coming more complex and dynamic. Besides the large sets of process vari- ants to be managed in such dynamic systems, process variants need to be context sensitive in order to accommodate new user requirements and intrinsic complexity. This paradigm shift forces us to defer decisions to runtime where process variants must be customized and executed based on a recognized context. However, there exists a lack of deferral of the entire process variant configuration and execution to perform an auto- mated decision of subsequent variation points at runtime. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to automatically resolve process vari- ability at runtime. The proposed solution performs a staged configuration considering static and dynamic context data to accomplish effective de- cision making. We demonstrate our approach by exemplifying a storage operation process in a smart logistics scenario. Our evaluation demon- strates the performance and scalability results of our methodology.", "authors": ["Aitor Murguzur", "Xabier De Carlos", "Salvador Trujillo", "Goiuria Sagardui"], "n_citation": 17, "references": ["0c44460f-f903-491d-86aa-cb9acc6195ce", "1c59b784-f37e-4f91-830a-1854c71a9d67", "1cf5d426-6fcd-4f7e-bea8-47563995fdf1", "1e262154-167f-47a4-863b-bf7090bc12f6", "2183a9e6-5c3e-40c4-9242-ea601dbcf269", "287d3a10-73c3-44b5-afc2-92b344ce55fc", "3ac62a82-475e-436d-9cb2-2ff40e7c52c2", "623f9f85-224d-4e84-83d9-f47ff6fd530a", "6f63bfe9-a11a-4ef9-9fc7-99d844d2dd1f", "74424e38-e59b-434f-b1bd-725e88efa24c", "7cd163f9-71ac-44a7-810d-0dcff00497f0", "c9cf5470-888a-434e-85a6-e27c79094a92", "d22c1316-0dec-489c-b2ae-c678666945be", "ded566c6-89e7-465d-bbfd-a5e0c4546953", "e2f91e8c-b0b9-4ce1-a8b5-e5f28893f483", "f3c71e61-e69d-4411-bda1-d63c988507b1", "fac86b5d-de78-4185-9f40-b8309796f067", "ff7adeba-edb8-4b2d-a8d4-71afaf90f285"], "title": "Context-Aware Staged Configuration of Process Variants@Runtime", "venue": "conference on advanced information systems engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "074ff4d0-27b3-4854-8996-0c7adff14ce8"}

{"abstract": "Gene tree parsimony (GTP) problems infer species supertrees from a collection of rooted gene trees that are confounded by evolutionary events like gene duplication, gene duplication and loss, and deep coalescence. These problems are NP-complete, and consequently, they often are addressed by effective local search heuristics that perform a stepwise search of the tree space, where each step is guided by an exact solution to an instance of a local search problem. Still, GTP problems require rooted input gene trees; however, in practice, most phylogenetic methods infer unrooted gene trees and it may be difficult to root correctly. In this work, we (i) define the first local NNI search problems to solve heuristically the GTP equivalents for unrooted input gene trees, called unrooted GTP problems, and (ii) describe linear time algorithms for these local search problems.

{"abstract": "We propose and show a parallel and distributed runtime environment for multi-agent systems that provides spatial agent migration ability by employing code morphing. The focus of the application scenario lies on sensor networks and low-power, resource-aware single System-On-Chip designs. An agent approach provides stronger autonomy than a traditional object or remote-procedure-call based approach. Agents can decide for themselves which actions are performed, and they are capable of reacting on the environment and other agents with flexible behaviour. Data processing nodes exchange code rather than data to transfer information. A part of the state of an agent is preserved within its own program code, which also implements the agent's migration functionality. The practicability of the approach is shown using a simple distributed Sobel filter as an example.", "authors": ["Stefan Bosse", "Florian Pantke", "Frank Kirchner"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["a4d227fc-da17-4bd8-996d-9053c3a03e2f"], "title": "Distributed computing in sensor networks using multi-agent systems and code morphing", "venue": "international conference on artificial intelligence and soft computing", "year": 2012, "id": "07f6d4ba-fb98-4988-bf9a-79225234ea1d"}
{"abstract": "Introduction: Public health surveillance systems need to be refined. We intend to use a generic approach for early identification of patients with severe influenza-like illness (ILI) by calculating a score that estimates a patient\u2019s disease-severity. Accordingly, we built the Intelligent Severity Score Estimation Model (ISSEM), structured so that the inference process would reflect experts\u2019 decisionmaking logic. Each patient\u2019s disease-severity score is calculated from numbers of respiratory ICD9 encounters, and laboratory, radiologic, and prescription-therapeutic orders in the EMR. Other ISSEM components include chronic disease evidence, probability of immunodeficiency, and the provider\u2019s general practice-behavior patterns. Results: Sensitivity was determined from 200 randomly selected patients with upper- and lowerrespiratory tract ILI; specificity, from 300 randomly selected patients with URI only. For different age groups, ISSEM sensitivity ranged between 90% and 95%; specificity was 72% to 84%. Conclusion: Our preliminary assessment of ISSEM performance demonstrated 93.5% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity across all age groups. Background", "authors": ["Zaruhi R. Mnatsakanyan", "Daniel J.

{"abstract": "Data skewness is a challenge encountered, in particular, when apply- ing supervised machine learning approaches in various domains, such as in healthcare and biomedical information engineering. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is a clinical strategy for prescribing treatment based on current best evi- dence for individual patients. Clinicians need to query publication repositories in order to find the best evidence to support their decision-making processes. This sophisticated information is materialised in the form of scientific artefacts in scholarly publications and the automatic extraction of these artefacts is a technical challenge for current generic search engines. Many classification ap- proaches have been proposed for identifying key scientific artefacts in EBM, however their performance is affected by the imbalanced characteristic of data in this domain. In this paper, we present four data balancing approaches applied in a binary ensemble classifier framework for classifying scientific artefacts in the EBM domain. Our balancing approaches improve the ensemble classifier's F-score by up to 15% for classes of scientific artefacts with extremely low cov- erage in the domain. In addition, we propose a classifier selection method for choosing the best classifier based on the distributional feature of classes. The resulting classifiers show improved classification performances when compared to state of the art approaches.", "authors": ["Hamed Hassanzadeh", "Tudor Groza", "Anthony Nguyen", "Jane Hunter"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["03299260-9046-4b00-b1f0-6fe94c6bee31", "0ce65577-0bcd-418a-990e-2866cd3d6914", "2076f2d8-e5eb-4f82-98ae-0cc80f69c0fb", "2e747b99-e8d9-4983-9e0d-8c316484dc2c", "4435e965-4037-4be0-84c8-fb12fc6e9df3", "5ccce3c6-6967-41c5-a266-1f19b9f3595f", "5e148b25-36a0-4715-b14c-08a2ea6edadc", "6f620bdf-5879-4e2e-9c2c-ab3cd2f9eff7", "9742db56-9481-414f-9f78-c8f1ad4f8688", "aee42a83-57cf-4624-8579-c1a81b2af264", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473"], "title": "Load Balancing for Imbalanced Data Sets: Classifying Scientific Artefacts for Evidence Based Medicine", "venue": "pacific rim international conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2014, "id": "08633eb6-25d0-45c7-b2c3-219e0b7248a4"}

For example, they are vital to banking applications, communication of electronic systems, air traf\ufb01c control, manufacturing automation, biomedical operation works, space monitoring systems and robotics information systems. As the nature of computing comes to be increasingly directed towards intelligence and autonomy, intelligent computations will be the key for all future applications. Intelligent distributed computing will become the base for the growth of an innovative generation of intelligent distributed systems. Nowadays, research centres require the development of architectures of intelligent and collaborated systems; these systems must be capable of solving problems by themselves to save processing time and reduce costs. Building an intelligent style of distributed computing that controls the whole distributed system requires communications that must be based on a completely consistent system. The model of the ideal system to be adopted in building an intelligent distributed computing structure is the human body system, speci\ufb01cally the body\u2019s cells.

{"abstract": "In this paper we re-examine the well known problem of asynchronous black hole search in a ring. It is well known that at least 2 agents are needed and the total number of agents' moves is at least \u03a9(n log n); solutions indeed exist that allow a team of two agents to locate the black hole with the asymptotically optimal cost of \u0398(n log n) moves.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we first of all determine the exact move complexity of black hole search in an asynchronous ring. In fact, we prove that 3n log3 n-O(n) moves are necessary. We then present a novel algorithm that allows two agents to locate the black hole with at most 3n log3 n + O(n) moves, improving the existing upper bounds, and matching the lower bound up to the constant of proportionality. Finally we show how to modify the protocol so to achieve asymptotically optimal time complexity \u0398(n), still with 3n log3 n + O(n) moves; this improves upon all existing time-optimal protocols, which require O(n2) moves. This protocol is the first that is optimal with respect to all three complexity measures: size (number of agents), cost (number of moves) and time; in particular, its cost and size complexities match the lower bounds up to the constant.", "authors": ["Balasingham Balamohan", "Paola Flocchini", "Ali Miri", "Nicola Santoro"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["084fdbdf-147e-40c9-bbde-3f402e70aee0", "0863919a-7f04-422f-a3fb-f32451886d06", "0e34dac8-fbb0-45e1-95e3-351b3f4489a1", "14e44f98-d133-4f6e-b27e-9cb770fdb68d", "1fe312d0-b1bb-495d-add2-cfc74dd7fee8", "28fd05bd-40c6-4449-b2d8-f7043e45540e", "29292e0c-b4ca-440f-bb34-9244f4ee91ae", "2ed9dca1-26a1-438d-9991-f7e1ab3f569d", "4835d03a-3f83-46cc-a273-381200f612f0", "538d2009-f810-495d-a30e-d626ba893ca9", "723c59a7-9faf-4b3b-bb66-ff250e5414f8", "74968918-a562-4a00-9531-a9cde2e55879", "80abf684-d4b9-4b6b-be8e-bef94437484c", "842f4121-d4c4-4e30-b71e-21157f999234", "8c319c10-0b45-4807-b0ea-e034107df31f", "8f1f4c71-0ba2-4407-99ce-b6fe0e1b9697", "bca41329-1f39-4929-957d-581675aa24a1", "e87a9331-c89b-4d5b-a754-952477b7ab10", "eeb4b412-6675-4db7-890e-03913c9774ed", "fa6e1cca-0703-4229-803d-274ee88f7b81"], "title": "Improving the optimal bounds for black hole search in rings", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "08785973-8224-40f9-bf67-324cfb78238b"}

Semantic analysis of questions is performed in order to extract key word used in retrieval queries and to detect the expected answer type. Semantic analysis of retrieved paragraphs includes checking the presence of entities of the expected answer type and extracting logical relations between words. A paragraph is considered to justify an answer if similar relations are present in the question.

On one hand, issues of continuous wireless connectivity and mobility management must be solved in future heterogeneous mobile Internet architectures with ever growing traffic demands. On the other hand, Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) must be guaranteed in a reliable, robust and diagnostically acceptable way.

{"abstract": "Utilization of camera systems for surveillance tasks (e. g. traffic monitoring) has become a standard procedure and has been in use for over 20 years. However, most of the cameras are operated locally and data analyzed manually. Locally means here a limited field of view and that the image sequences are processed independently from other cameras. For the enlargement of the observation area and to avoid occlusions and non-accessible areas multiple camera systems with overlapping and non-overlapping cameras are used. The joint processing of image sequences of a multi-camera system is a scientific and technical challenge. The processing is divided traditionally into camera calibration, object detection, tracking and interpretation. The fusion of information from different cameras is carried out in the world coordinate system. To reduce the network load, a distributed processing concept can be implemented.#R##N##R##N#Object detection and tracking are fundamental image processing tasks for scene evaluation. Situation assessments are based mainly on characteristic local movement patterns (e.g. directions and speed), from which trajectories are derived. It is possible to recognize atypical movement patterns of each detected object by comparing local properties of the trajectories. Interaction of different objects can also be predicted with an additional classification algorithm.#R##N##R##N#This presentation discusses trajectory based recognition algorithms for atypical event detection in multi object scenes to obtain area based types of information (e.g. maps of speed patterns, trajectory curvatures or erratic movements) and shows that two-dimensional areal data analysis of moving objects with multiple cameras offers new possibilities for situational analysis.", "authors": ["Ralf Reulke", "Dominik Rue\u00df", "Kristian Manthey", "Andreas Luber"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0fd21eb3-a0fa-47df-81b3-3decd40e7f41", "11b36e1c-c93b-4e12-820c-30e43cca673c", "27afbfc7-d29a-4061-a67b-d8e124bf3f7c", "2a8729d8-0911-4ea6-88d1-17bd24e53aa1", "2d479dbc-9e18-4ea1-8b70-eaacb0b06b7a", "34b61f45-4695-404b-b59f-d9ff4d0d4a0f", "4deecabf-7a1b-44ee-870d-237d7fcf925c", "60285266-7da2-474e-b05a-b380c836f665", "7802ebdc-6e4c-4501-b1cf-899ad51c0c1a", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "947c177a-cdcd-42c1-9999-3bf5f5811735", "94e708cf-5cf4-40f2-bc87-1ac8ddb6bef9", "9775a0d7-bf2c-4dcc-8682-5cabeabd33c7", "a2a72c14-fed4-47f1-b913-c97119529fb0", "a941db08-2328-441a-9f7a-f52dd000fec9", "ac2a8c3c-cb85-487e-80d0-937f17959002", "c98c332d-0aa7-4c94-a3fe-3f131e2fdb7a", "c9fa31f7-f6ce-49ea-b42c-8d03ae59dbe4", "e0a4505e-ceb4-47ec-8c95-8b22c07cb53b", "ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030", "ed1f198d-d98c-4cee-a565-286ae5d4801b"], "title": "Traffic observation and situation assessment", "venue": "international conference on computer vision", "year": 2011, "id": "0a89c062-028f-43bf-a2cb-92e54f0b4d72"}

Today's Web was designed primarily for human use. To enable reliable, large-scale automated interoperation of services by computer programs or agents, the properties, capabilities, interfaces and effects of Web services must be understandable to computers. In this paper we propose a vision and a partial realization of precisely this. We propose markup of Web services in the DAML family of semantic Web markup languages.

{"abstract": "In this chapter, I discuss my experiences applying Problem-Based Learn- ing to technical IT courses such as mathematics and computer application design and programming. One of the hallmarks of nearly any technical concentration is a critical need to develop strong individual, and typically challenging, technical skill sets early in the program, and high dependence on these skill sets in later courses, internships, and ultimately professional work or graduate studies. Another hallmark of the IT field is a need for strong metacognitive skills to analyze complex scenarios and the ability to creatively use their technical skill sets to synthesize new solutions and create working systems, much like an artist creates new works. The chapter is a reflection of how I try to: (1) Structure early courses to help stu- dents rapidly gain difficult technical skill sets without crushing their will to contin- ue as a result of harsh weed-out techniques, but at the same time rigorously demand and assess progress; (2) Balance conflicts between the desire for rapid and efficient assessment versus the need for detailed and careful assessment that avoids gaming of the assessment system by students; (3) Gradually push technical students away from memorize-and-regurgitate learning approaches and towards an independent learning model; and (4) Help students make the transition from early individual- ized skill set development to wider-scale analysis and creative synthesis of complex systems.", "authors": ["David R.

{"abstract": "It is well known that, as the dimensionality of a metric space increases, metric search techniques become less effective and the cost of indexing mechanisms becomes greater than the saving they give. This is due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. One effect of increasing dimensionality is that the ratio of unit hypersphere to unit hypercube volume decreases rapidly, making the solution to a similarity query (the query ball, or hypersphere) ever more difficult to identify by using metric invariants such as triangle inequality. In this paper we take a different approach, by identifying points within a query polyhedron rather than a ball. We show how this can be achieved by constructing a surrogate metric space, such that a query ball in the surrogate space corresponds to a polyhedron in the original space. If the polyhedron contains the ball, the overall cost of the query is likely to be increased in high dimensions; however, we show that shrinking the polyhedron can capture a surprisingly high proportion of the points within the ball, whilst at the same time giving a more efficient, and more scalable, search. We show results which confirm our underlying hypothesis. In some cases we can retrieve significant volumes of query results from spaces which are otherwise intractable.", "authors": ["Richard C. H.

This paper presents an artificial intelligence approach to automatically construct annotation pipelines for given information needs and quality prioritizations. Based on an abstract ontological model, we use partial order planning to select a pipeline's algorithms and informed search to obtain an efficient pipeline schedule. We realized the approach as an expert system on top of Apache UIMA, which offers evidence that pipelines can be constructed ad-hoc in near-zero time.", "authors": ["Henning Wachsmuth", "Mirko Rose", "Gregor Engels"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["03f4361e-e252-46f0-a6b3-766a35cc16ca", "0a72fadc-7a2e-43f7-b2e3-21a5a7ec0d1e", "380ce983-19cd-4292-b741-18dd02768964", "4fe39d4a-0427-4878-b585-30c1f75fcb8a", "57a70ffc-e3b7-4547-adae-d59e12c9e50d", "640c2316-b195-44b9-9e82-18db188130ef", "6e0e444a-a974-4d7d-8166-368cd702dc37", "837f98b0-21a8-4cd4-863e-071dda1fa615", "88591ede-7bf5-44a8-8b8a-30d311bb886b", "89c4c986-221a-4ed8-b8bb-30499c84d53b", "b5f74013-faee-4012-b503-90408f4cea95", "c82ee9a9-fe7d-44bb-aafb-96173675eec8", "d8b485d0-701b-447f-880b-2908f6e2f8cd", "eeee0b01-dd70-4c8d-862a-104194bcf04b", "fd84301d-d771-4cc8-8b57-56b9692dad38", "fea77781-83eb-466e-86bc-0515f2dc85d3", "ffad9620-16a2-4b48-ad28-bebfc84686a6"], "title": "Automatic pipeline construction for real-time annotation", "venue": "international conference on computational linguistics", "year": 2013, "id": "0e08de32-0004-40d3-8d99-ea9713f79aae"}

{"abstract": "Accurately locating users in a wireless environment is an important task for many pervasive computing and AI applications, such as activity recognition. In a WiFi environment, a mobile device can be localized using signals received from various transmitters, such as access points (APs). Most localization approaches build a map between the signal space and the physical location space in a offline phase, and then using the received-signal-strength (RSS) map to estimate the location in an online phase. However, the map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics. It is infeasible or expensive to repeat data calibration for reconstructing the RSS map. In such a case, it is important to adapt the model learnt in one time period to another time period without too much recalibration. In this paper, we present a location-estimation approach based on Manifold co-Regularization, which is a machine learning technique for building a mapping function between data. We describe LeManCoR, a system for adapting the mapping function between the signal space and physical location space over different time periods based on Manifold Co-Regularization. We show that LeManCoR can effectively transfer the knowledge between two time periods without requiring too much new calibration effort.

{"abstract": "Knowledge of how a science data product has been generated is a critical component to determining its fitness-for-use for a given analysis. One objective of science information systems is to allow users to search for data products based on a wide range of criteria; spatial and temporal extent, observed parameter, research domain, and organizational project are common search criteria. Currently, science information systems are geared towards helping users find data, but not in helping users determine how the products were generated. An information system that exposes the provenance of available data products, that is what observations, assumptions, and science processing were involved in the generation of the data products, would contribute significant benefit to user fitness-for-use decision-making.#R##N##R##N#In this work we discuss semantics-driven provenance extensions to the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO) information system. The VSTO semantic web portal uses an ontology to provide a unified search and product retrieval interface to data in the fields of solar, solar-terrestrial, and space physics. We have developed an extension to the VSTO ontology that allows it to express item-level data product records. We will show how the Open Provenance Model (OPM) and the Proof Markup Language (PML) can be used to express the provenance of data product records. Additionally, we will discuss ways in which domain semantics can aid in the formulation - and answering - of provenance queries.

{"abstract": "This study is focused on querying accomplished on structured spaces of information. Querying is understood in terms of mining structures of information and of knowledge understanding. We consider information as a subject of descriptions expressed in some language. Information is hidden behind such descriptions. Operations done on structured spaces of information are performed on language constructions describing such structures. However, automatic operations not always can be performed directly on language constructions. In such cases it is necessary to expand performance to the space of information. The study concerns paginated (i.e. printed and handwritten) music notation. It is shown that querying in the space of music information requires syntactic structuring as well as its expansion to semantic analysis. It is worth underlining that data understanding requires analysis of uncertainty: analyzed data are usually incomplete, uncertain and with some incorrectness. Such imperfectness of information is hidden under the level of syntax and semantics. Due to limitation of the paper this problem is not studied.", "authors": ["Wladyslaw Homenda", "Mariusz Rybnik"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["0ebb0b84-824a-47c4-8daf-3ef005e1aafc", "1a4c73cc-532a-42f0-bb59-0489f33c9640", "1dd6aa6d-f794-4153-85e9-84b626cf49f2", "7f1cde3b-b069-4245-8dbb-510cf42974f7", "b60d309d-11f0-424e-8ad0-db741eabb70d", "ee80ce42-8969-4006-b0e3-1fa8f69c69d1"], "title": "Querying in spaces of music information", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "0f27b0a9-4520-44e7-a589-4b9ab4248821"}
{"abstract": "Agriculture is the dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy but it is characterized by low productivity. Ethiopia is interested in creating access to agricultural knowledge through an agricultural knowledge management system (AKMS). Such a system has been developed using a web-based portal named Ethiopian Agriculture Portal (EAP). It is facilitated through Woreda Knowledge Centers (WKCs) which are in 10 Pilot Learning Woredas (PLW). Providing knowledge in the appropriate format, identification of affordable technological infrastructure, and integrating indigenous agricultural knowledge into the knowledge system is vital to empowering development agents (extension workers) in Ethiopia. This study addresses two research questions: 1)To what extent does the centralized AKMS support WKCs access and utilization of agricultural knowledge? 2) How can the existing AKMS support capturing and sharing of indigenous agricultural knowledge and best practices?", "authors": ["Monica J.

{"abstract": "It has been widely observed that different NLP applications require different sense granularities in order to best exploit word sense distinctions, and that for many applications WordNet senses are too fine-grained. In contrast to previously proposed automatic methods for sense clustering, we formulate sense merging as a supervised learning problem, exploiting human-labeled sense clusterings as training data. We train a discriminative classifier over a wide variety of features derived from WordNet structure, corpus-based evidence, and evidence from other lexical resources. Our learned similarity measure outperforms previously proposed automatic methods for sense clustering on the task of predicting human sense merging judgments, yielding an absolute F-score improvement of 4.1% on nouns, 13.6% on verbs, and 4.0% on adjectives. Finally, we propose a model for clustering sense taxonomies using the outputs of our classifier, and we make available several automatically sense-clustered WordNets of various sense granularities.", "authors": ["Rion Snow", "Sushant Prakash", "Daniel Jurafsky", "Andrew Y.

{"abstract": "Patch management of networks is essential to mitigate the risks from the exploitation of vulnerabilities through malware and other attacks, but by set- ting too rigorous a patching policy for network devices the IT security team can also create burdens for IT operations or disruptions to the business. Different patch deployment timelines could be adopted with the aim of reducing this op- erational cost, but care must be taken not to substantially increase the risk of emergency disruption from potential exploits and attacks. In this paper we ex- plore how the IT security policy choices regarding patching timelines can be made in terms of economically-based decisions, in which the aim is to minimize the expected overall costs to the organization from patching-related activity. We introduce a simple cost function that takes into account costs incurred from dis- ruption caused by planned patching and from expected disruption caused by emergency patching. To explore the outcomes under different patching policies we apply a systems modelling approach and Monte Carlo style simulations. The results from the simulations show disruptions caused for a range of patch dep- loyment timelines. These results together with the cost function are then used to identify the optimal patching timelines under different threat environment con- ditions and taking into account the organization's risk tolerance.", "authors": ["Yolanta Beres", "Jonathan Griffin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["05db0573-9e8e-4144-a1cf-996b6b2eece6", "1fa9751a-1578-430a-96b2-e513439ec70a", "2fcee12b-62d3-419d-80f7-4a491438fad9", "379f4c41-3cab-4b95-bacd-17f8a49ace43", "5baa351c-3a76-4a21-b499-a81f048b628c", "bca6d5e8-c1e9-4180-b551-cfc6e3ba6ac4"], "title": "Optimizing Network Patching Policy Decisions", "venue": "information security", "year": 2012, "id": "0f6f82ba-6712-4985-a9cb-11ebbb388dbd"}

The goal of the work is to support computer-enhanced distance collaboration, where domain-specific recognizers handle different kinds of digital ink input and editing. The first of these recognizers is for mathematics, which allows converting math input into machine-understandable format.

{"abstract": "One of the goals of translational science is to shorten the time from discovery to clinical use. Clinical trial registries were established to increase transparency in completed and ongoing clinical trials, and they support linking trials with resulting publications. We set out to investigate precision and negative predictive value (NPV) of links between ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) and PubMed. CT.gov has been established to increase transparency in clinical trials and the link to PubMed is crucial for supporting a number of important functions, including ascertaining publication bias. We drew a random sample of trials downloaded from CT.gov and performed manual review of retrieved publications. We characterize two types of links between trials and publications (NCT-link originating from MEDLINE and PMID-link originating from CT.gov).The link precision is different based on type (NCT-link: 100%; PMID-link: 63% to 96%). In trials with no linked publication, we were able to find publications 44% of the time (NPV=56%) by searching PubMed. This low NPV shows that there are potentially numerous publications that should have been formally linked with the trials.

{"abstract": "In previous works a novel flexible and versatile handling concept, called PARAGRIP(Parallel Gripping), was introduced. This concept is based ona reconfigurable architecture with a modular and alterable layout. The robot system is able to handle objects with six DOF by forming a parallel kinematic structure including several robotic arms and the object itself. As many kinematic parameters, like the grasp- and base-points of the arms as well as the arm combination can be designed freely, the handling system offers a fast and economic possibility to adapt the performances to the requirements of the task. This adaption can proceed before or even during manipulation. The latter is realized by dynamic re-grasping, where the object is passed from one arm to the next, if more than three arms are available in the layout.#R##N##R##N#This Paper deals with the question how an optimal configuration set can be planned automatically, if the robot layout offers the possibility of dynamic re-grasping.

{"abstract": "Business processes are recognized by organizations as one of the most important intangible assets, since they let organizations improve their competitiveness. Business processes are supported by enterprise information systems, which can evolve over time and embed particular business rules that are not present anywhere else. Thus, there are many organizations with inaccurate business processes, which prevent the modernization of enterprise information systems in line with the business processes that they support. Therefore, business process mining techniques are often used to retrieve reliable business processes from the event logs recorded during the execution of enterprise systems. Unfortunately, such event logs are represented with purpose-specific notations such as Mining XML and still don't apply the recent software modernization standard: ISO 19506 (KDM, Knowledge Discovery Metamodel). This paper presents an exogenous model transformation between these two notations. The main advantage is that process mining techniques can be effectively reused within software modernization projects according to the standard notation. This paper is particularly focused on the empirical evaluation of this transformation by simulating different kinds of business process models and several event logs with different sizes and configurations from such models. After analyzing all the model transformation executions, the study demonstrates that the transformation can provide suitable KDM models in a linear time in accordance with the size of the input models.", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez-Ropero", "Ricardo P\u00e9rez-Castillo", "Barbara Weber", "Mario Piattini"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["08e139c7-baf8-4ed3-a927-31c62d2a5a5c", "0a565bab-0582-425b-bc05-84441a637b23", "0f4e538e-9062-45be-af32-49466c4d3e39", "3b7888ce-f0ad-4f99-a8b9-a2091f9f3096", "40cea306-08e1-4228-abb5-2051a463ced6", "4185a249-a450-48bc-bf2c-94d7b86cc862", "4a7f8af0-c721-4958-9043-0d9ba37ad064", "51e2a1cd-ea17-4040-95bd-1a036b58213d", "6519f146-d16f-4912-8d95-3a67c1ae8625", "659063dd-f2d7-491a-a83c-d372beabc85b", "73a51074-5f46-41b5-a271-d5b1a3176206", "873aac9a-7ae4-44d7-a9be-b03a4453f473", "9d90c20c-6d4c-45a3-8388-977099a2abd1", "b409eb3e-db34-49a4-99d5-48e6edb05eb6", "b7a2ec6b-8ba0-43e1-9834-be800dbfcac4", "b8c3a82f-79fa-4397-90df-20ae83158e7a", "c284d49e-c5dc-47be-816f-ac804c862de6", "d532c8e3-647b-4b28-848f-e891f6861754"], "title": "Empirical assessment of business model transformations based on model simulation", "venue": "international conference on model transformation", "year": 2012, "id": "10de5912-723f-4edc-8d3f-5fc723169498"}

{"abstract": "In the domain of ontology design as well as in Knowledge Representation, modeling universals is a challenging problem. Most approaches that have addressed this problem rely on Description Logics (DLs) but many difficulties remain , due to under-constrained representation which reduces the inferences that can be drawn and further causes problems in expressiveness. In mathematical logic and program checking, type theories have proved to be appealing but, so far they have not been applied in the formalization of ontologies. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper a theory for representing ontologies in a de pendently- typed framework which relies on strong formal foundations including both a constructive logic and a functional type system. The language of this theory defines in a precise way what ontol ogical primitives such as classes, relations, properties, etc., and thereof roles, are. The first part of the paper details how the se primitives are defined and used within the theory. In a seco nd part, we focus on the formalization of the role primitive. A review of significant role properties leads to the specificati on of a role profile and most of the remaining work details through nu merous examples, how the proposed theory is able to fully satisfy this profile. It is demonstrated that dependent types can mod el several non-trivial aspects of roles including a formal s olution for generalization hierarchies, identity criteria for roles a nd other contributions. A discussion is given on how the theory is able to cope with many of the constraints inherent in a good role representation.", "authors": ["Patrick Barlatier", "Richard Dapoigny"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["02820152-4296-4e06-9104-ce4a54b6dca3", "04edcaec-b50d-41a4-88ef-e44f78341d95", "0606831b-4490-4f0e-9a17-429fdae696fd", "07ec78ab-3d0f-4581-b778-ccc356f6fd46", "08960518-5fb7-408b-a812-43e935face3b", "0c57c1fc-b8b7-469a-bd8b-8056ba72632b", "0d5f2eae-f748-4286-8f63-9bcc43f3aaa3", "119c95bf-d999-4f7f-bf23-123a7794abaa", "1c906634-46e9-4bc6-9cbe-3cb57ffb5a28", "23af7984-1394-4270-84a2-1b01b35dabfc", "2c6ba557-37e1-46e8-b108-0631fe1ca4f2", "350df4f6-ddf7-46a0-a5fc-e680da21423f", "35ae8959-22a6-45c5-b5f9-51bb6342d8d6", "40ab296a-db74-419c-a81b-e016d4929199", "42ea6086-62ba-4bfa-b59c-4e454c848818", "43df1764-f766-4e24-b765-0dd6a26fd1bc", "45ec0bdb-6e26-4bbd-a311-b410ae947445", "48a31150-e17c-4ded-a124-f1fbca300338", "534622c5-a19e-48d8-9253-521f321c3d23", "53abf736-2a17-47c4-82cf-7f6d5ea31337", "5447b29f-87ab-4256-8928-23ee3120297c", "57edf159-2cc8-44d7-a1da-5b03c0e744db", "5c32b10a-de2f-4e89-8651-a5235a68863a", "6832defa-3186-470b-8d8b-2509416a6802", "6f21d24f-8227-4c35-87c3-47b7a664d763", "747598a7-0b4e-4f5d-89de-2bc5db2c639d", "7abd6364-bb52-4041-99be-2ae330b8731e", "8028aecc-1569-49ea-b319-6726105a93ee", "80a4bf7a-2283-4b7e-8b17-33cf6b1bb0af", "822b3043-dbf8-4b4f-a7bc-243b39b4149a", "84a66ce3-6c67-4839-b3f8-9d627f1a1d36", "84da7a7f-33b9-4a69-aeed-550aeed4d015", "8907ca33-433c-4750-9212-540abcd9284d", "8a19d900-fb03-418a-a54c-186f23bf8621", "8aa3fa57-36ab-4b19-8bc1-fabe568e1526", "8cf80590-eba6-4709-b017-8bdb970839f2", "8f20541f-b2be-4dac-ae1f-bf137e388abc", "9328c443-f08b-48cc-be07-c5bbe802a1b3", "953cb449-ec71-45ad-a063-43f2cdccacc3", "96406430-a308-44da-ace7-f8e902560001", "a52c089c-9222-4085-91c7-93b217adc8a8", "a6c13b12-6562-42b8-8062-8ff08ac1dcdb", "a9b12a52-7ec0-4a9b-b3b2-1065df9fe78d", "aac42eb9-c856-47c1-b3c7-b5cbbd8b47db", "ad9def37-73cd-4e06-8a51-49a1dfd3b0a8", "af96fd5a-b78a-4424-8e12-a854988fef6a", "b41b51ad-9aae-49d2-b2ab-a2a73a6d1b8b", "c5b4c9f2-a58e-4110-9f65-af0ddad21c6c", "c8fc9f4a-4004-4f82-850b-a70cb7f24b74", "cac3fade-381c-4f94-9b19-b3d6aa0553c4", "d4f5860d-0fa6-4ffd-b940-b0773b27b0ad", "d84ee860-5736-4169-a73e-caaa37d2ed62", "dfaefc6b-783d-4a23-a25a-f2236b033467", "e7fda079-9f7c-4f1d-a889-aaaebbad668d", "e8529a4e-7df7-405f-9ea3-30ff0d1261a1", "ec02bd03-1909-4362-a565-fd08669a8c67", "ecfb2022-e18c-4e5e-8733-d8bc6f4c8fc9", "f67b5f23-8c2d-45f7-b82d-8b52350668eb", "fa84ddb9-42f4-4b55-95a3-2d40e493c852", "ff259fbc-bf17-4de5-81dd-b624ba957170", "ff9769f1-5d32-432b-9213-f8b38dea912b"], "title": "A type-theoretical approach for ontologies: The case of roles", "venue": "Applied Ontology", "year": 2012, "id": "11755fa7-5aa6-4a90-ad8d-931db56eb3df"}

The proposed method based on the edge sensing technique improves the interpolation performance by adopting the color difference model for a green channel as well as a red/blue channel. In particular, the green channel interpolation method with a new concept includes the gradient operator, which uses the total amount of slope changes in adjacent color information, and the missing green color estimation, which uses Approximated Directional Line Averages. Comparing with various comparative experiments between the conventional results and the proposed ones, the performances of the proposed method in this paper outperform to existing algorithms in terms of visual performance both in numerical and visual aspects.

Genetic algorithms appear to be useful for solving such problems when dealing with nonlinear, large-scale systems.

{"abstract": "The gulf separating the real-time research, product development, and application development communities appears to be the largest in the entire computing field. This gulf has an unfortunate tendency to obscure the research opportunities of most value to the real-time application domains. It is an unsurprising consequence of factors historically intrinsic to each of those communities.Almost all academic, and much industrial, research in the area of real-time computing - and especially distributed real-time computing - suffers from two handicaps. First is the necessity for unusually extensive application domain-specific knowledge and understanding compared with what is required in most other computer science and engineering research. Second is the directly contrary reality that few real-time researchers have the option of obtaining such knowledge and understanding, because they lack access to non-trivial, deployed, real-time application environments - particularly to distributed ones (e.g., in process control or discrete manufacturing plants, defense systems, telecommunication intelligent network architectures) - and to the developers and users of those environments.The real-time application domain practitioners (real-time computer product and application developers and users) contribute to this gulf as well. First, the historical focus on traditional small, static, centralized, sampled-data subsystems has often subjected real-time computers to severe constraints on hardware cost, size, weight, and power. And although software development and maintenance costs per line of source code are generally one or two orders of magnitude greater for real-time software than for non-real-time software, the smallest scale instances of these subsystems actually have negligible costs for software compared with hardware. These two factors tend to discourage many of the application developers and users from believing that they need or can afford technology advances from the software and real-time research communities. Second, hardware parsimony makes it necessary, and application simplicity makes it possible, for the application programmers to do the majority of the system's resource management - most of it a' priori, and as little as possible at run time.The increasing importance and deployment of larger scale, more complex, more distributed real-time computer systems makes this gulf an increasingly greater obstacle to their cost-effectiveness and even viability. The purpose of this session is to assist in reducing this gulf by bringing to ISORC2K's researcher audience some of the most prominent visionaries in some of real-time computing's most important application domains.", "authors": ["E.

EFES reduces the dependence upon modeling specialists, and thus, makes models, both analytical and simulation, more accessible to decision-makers.

{"abstract": "The morphological changes of the vertebrae associated with normal aging are still subject of debate, whereas this knowledge is important in detecting vertebral fractures and degenerative shape changes. The aim of this study is to present a method to statistically analyze the vertebral shape and determining the morphometric changes related to normal aging. The analysis is performed on the L2 lumbar vertebrae from a large dataset of Computed Tomography scans. The surface meshes of all vertebrae, with a groupwise vertex correspondence between them, are first acquired by an intensity based registration process onto a segmented reference. Principal component analysis then reduces the dimensionality to the main modes of variation which were subsequently analyzed by multiple linear regression to acquire the global shape variations with respect to the age of the subjects. In addition, the correlation with age of the deformation at each mesh vertex is analyzed, giving a significance map of the age related changes. This analysis shows several shape changes which are in agreement with previous studies while also giving a more detailed global shape analysis. Understanding the normal shape changes allows for a better diagnosis of vertebral fractures and spinal pathologies.", "authors": ["Tristan Whitmarsh", "Luis Miguel del R\u00edo Barquero", "Silvana Di Gregorio", "Jorge Malouf Sierra", "Ludovic Humbert", "Alejandro F.

{"abstract": "We study the role of help in Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge protocols and its relation to the standard interactive model. In the classical case, we show that help and interaction are equivalent, answering an open question of Ben-Or and Gutfreund. This implies a new complete problem for the class SZK, the Image Intersection Density. For this problem, we also prove a polarization lemma which is stronger than the previously known one. #R##N#In the quantum setting, we define the notion of quantum help and show in a more direct way that help and interaction are again equivalent. Moreover, we define quantum Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge with classical help and prove that it is equal to the class of languages that have classical honest-Verifier Zero Knowledge protocols secure against quantum Verifiers. Last, we provide new complete problems for all these quantum classes. #R##N#Similar results were independently discovered by Dragos Florin Ciocan and Salil Vadhan.", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Chailloux", "Iordanis Kerenidis"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0dd040aa-d2e6-447d-ad59-c2a19b828c99"], "title": "The role of help in Classical and Quantum Zero-Knowledge", "venue": "arXiv: Quantum Physics", "year": 2007, "id": "13f052cc-382b-437e-af19-84140b4a3a1e"}

{"abstract": "Multiple datasets that add high value to biomedical research have been exposed on the web as a part of the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) Cloud. The ability to easily navigate through these datasets is crucial for personalized medicine and the improvement of drug discovery process. However, navigating these multiple datasets is not trivial as most of these are only available as isolated SPARQL endpoints with very little vocabulary reuse. The content that is indexed through these endpoints is scarce, making the indexed dataset opaque for users. In this paper, we propose an approach for the creation of an active Linked Life Sciences Data Roadmap, a set of congurable rules which can be used to discover links (roads) between biological entities (cities) in the LSLOD cloud. We have catalogued and linked concepts and properties from 137 public SPARQL endpoints. Our Roadmap is primarily used to dynamically assemble queries retrieving data from multiple SPARQL endpoints simultaneously. We also demonstrate its use in conjunction with other tools for selective SPARQL querying, semantic annotation of experimental datasets and the visualization of the LSLOD cloud. We have evaluated the performance of our approach in terms of the time taken and entity capture. Our approach, if generalized to encompass other domains, can be used for road-mapping the entire LOD cloud.", "authors": ["Ali Hasnain", "Syeda Sana e Zainab", "Maulik R.
